### Hiya!

My name's Ceci and I go by she/her pronouns! <br/>
I'm a queer woman with a passion for developing sustainable apps and libraries that aim to solve real problems.

**Some such apps I'm working on~**

- [protontweaks](https://github.com/ribbon-studios/protontweaks) (Automatically apply necessary protontricks to your games!)
- [tyria.ribbonstudios.com](https://github.com/ribbon-studios/tyria.ribbonstudios.com) (Achievement tracker for Guild Wars 2)
- [refreshly](https://github.com/ribbon-studios/refreshly) (A simple expandable key rotation tool)
- [salte-auth](https://github.com/salte-auth/salte-auth) (OAuth2 library developed by myself and widely utilized. Sunset with plans to develop a replacement)
- [utils](https://github.com/ribbon-studios/utils) (Local only implementation of your favorite tools.)
