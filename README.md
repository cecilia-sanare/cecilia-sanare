### Hiya!

My name's Ceci and I go by she/her pronouns! <br/>
I'm a queer woman with a passion for developing sustainable apps and libraries that aim to solve real problems.

**Some such apps I'm working on~**

- [refreshly](https://github.com/rain-cafe/refreshly) (A simple expandable key rotation tool)
- [salte-auth](https://github.com/salte-auth/salte-auth) (OAuth2 library developed by myself and widely utilized. Sunset with plans to develop a replacement)
- [utils](https://github.com/rain-cafe/utils) (Local only implementation of your favorite tools.)
- [silvy](https://github.com/rain-cafe-xiv/silvy) (An app for creating, sharing, and collaborating on strats for XIV)
- [flarie](https://github.com/rain-cafe/flarie) (A universal bot framework!~ ðŸ”¥)
