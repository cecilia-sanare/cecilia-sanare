### Hiya!

My name's Ceci and I go by she/her pronouns! <br/>
I'm a queer woman with a passion for developing sustainable apps and libraries that aim to solve real problems.

**Some such apps I'm working on~**

- [rains.cafe](https://github.com/rain-cafe/rains.cafe) (Homepage of my Org!)
- [silvy](https://github.com/rain-cafe-xiv/silvy) (An app for creating, sharing, and collaborating on strats for XIV)
- [rain-bot](https://github.com/rain-cafe-xiv/rain-bot) (Generic discord bot developed for the Rainbow Caf√© and sister discords)
- [salte-auth](https://github.com/salte-auth/salte-auth) (OAuth2 library developed by myself and widely utilized. Sunset with plans to develop a replacement)
