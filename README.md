### Hiya!

My name's Ceci and I go by she/her pronouns! 
I'm a queer woman with a passion for developing sustainable apps and libraries that aim to solve real problems.

Some such apps I'm working on~

- [rains.cafe](https://github.com/rain-cafe/rains.cafe) (Homepage of my Org!)
- [umbreon](https://github.com/rain-cafe/umbreon) (Authentication library intended to supercede [@salte-auth/salte-auth](https://github.com/salte-auth/salte-auth))
- [silvy](https://github.com/rain-cafe/rains.cafe) (Secret Project~ 🤫)
- [rain-bot](https://github.com/rain-cafe-xiv/rain-bot) (Generic discord bot developed for the Rainbow Café discord)
